This is a 2D game developed in the Unity engine. Furthur information will be added towards the final stages of development. Stay tuned...

# Rules
- You can only carry one package at a time.
- Your vehicle speed will increase for a limited time if you cross a booster.
- The vehicle's color will change into green if you are carrying a package in case you forget what you have done! It'll change back to blue after each successful delivery. 
- You have to find the customer in the game. The blue circle is representative of the customer for now! It'll change into something better in the future updates. 
- The green squares are the packages that you should pick up and deliver. They will disapear after you pick them up.
